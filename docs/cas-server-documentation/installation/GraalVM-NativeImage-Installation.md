# GraalVM Native Image Installation

[GraalVM Native Images](https://www.graalvm.org/native-image/) are standalone executables that can be generated by 
processing compiled Java applications ahead-of-time. Native Images generally have a smaller memory footprint and start faster than their JVM counterparts.

A CAS server installation and deployment process can be tuned to build and run as a GraalVM native image. Compared to the Java Virtual Machine, CAS server 
native images can run with a smaller memory footprint and with much faster startup times. A CAS GraalVM Native Image is a complete, platform-specific 
executable. You do not need to ship a Java Virtual Machine in order to run a CAS native image. It requires and uses ahead-of-time (AOT) processing in order to 
create an executable. This ahead-of-time processing involves statically analyzing CAS application code from its main entry point.

<div class="alert alert-warning">:warning: <strong>Usage Warning!</strong><p>
This capability is a work in progress, requires a lot of trial and error and is highly experimental at this point.</p></div>

There are some key differences between native and JVM-based CAS deployments. The main differences are:

- Static analysis of the CAS server is performed at build-time from the main entry point.
- Code that cannot be reached when the native image is created will be removed and won’t be part of the executable.
- GraalVM is not directly aware of dynamic elements in CAS code and must be told about reflection, resources, serialization, and dynamic proxies.
- The CAS server application classpath is fixed at build time and cannot change.
- There is no lazy class loading and everything shipped in the executables will be loaded in memory on startup.

During the AOT processing phase, the CAS web application is started up to the point that bean definitions 
are available. Bean instances are not created during the AOT processing phase. The AOT process will typically generate the following artifacts:

A Spring AOT processed application will typically generate:

- Java source code
- Bytecode (for dynamic proxies etc)
- GraalVM JSON hint files
  - Resource hints (`resource-config.json`)
  - Reflection hints (`reflect-config.json`)
  - Serialization hints (`serialization-config.json`)
  - Java Proxy Hints (`proxy-config.json`)
  - JNI Hints (`jni-config.json`)
      
Note that Hhnt files which put under `src/main/resources/META-INF/native-image` are automatically picked up by GraalVM.

## System Requirements

A GraalVM distribution compatible with the overall [CAS requirements](../planning/Installation-Requirements.html) must be present on the build machine.
Presently and at a minimum, you will need to have GraalVM `22.3.1` installed with 
the [native image tool](https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/) in place.

## Installation

The ability to build GraalVM native images is built directly into the CAS installation process. The installation script
can be deployed using the [CAS Initializr](../installation/WAR-Overlay-Initializr.html).

<div class="alert alert-info">:warning: <strong>Build Time</strong><p>
Building CAS GraalVM native images can be quite resource intensive and time consuming. Depending on the number of modules
included in the build, CAS configuration options and the horsepower of the build machine, the build time can vary greatly
and typically is in the neighborhood of <code>5~15</code> minutes and perhaps longer.</p></div>

## Known Limitations

CAS GraalVM native images are an evolving technology. Not all libraries used by CAS and not all modules offered by CAS
provide support for native images. Additionally, the following scenarios are unsupported or do require a lot of finesse
and maneuvering to function:
         
- All capabilities and features that load, parse and execute Groovy scripts, or load dynamic code constructs.
- Libraries and dependencies written in Groovy or other dynamic languages will be extremely challenging to support.
- All capabilities and features that load CAS configuration properties from external sources that backed by Spring Cloud.

If you find a library which doesn’t work with GraalVM, please discuss that issue
on the [reachability metadata project](https://github.com/oracle/graalvm-reachability-metadata).
