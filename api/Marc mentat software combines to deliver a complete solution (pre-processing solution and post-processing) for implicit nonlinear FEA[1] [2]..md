- **Nonlinear analysis**: Marc Mentat can simulate all kinds of nonlinearities, such as geometric nonlinearity (large strain and displacement), material nonlinearity (plasticity, hyperelasticity, viscoplasticity, creep, etc.), and boundary condition nonlinearity (contact, friction, etc.). It can also handle nonlinear dynamic problems such as impact, vibration, and fatigue.
- **Multiphysics analysis**: Marc Mentat can couple thermal, electrical, magnetic, structural, fluid, and acoustic analyses to simulate realistic physical phenomena. For example, it can model thermal stress, piezoelectric effect, induction heating, electrostatics, magnetostatics, etc.
- **Manufacturing process simulation**: Marc Mentat can simulate various manufacturing processes such as sheet metal forming, hydroforming, extrusion, blow molding, welding, quenching, curing, cutting, etc. It can also predict defects such as cracks, wrinkles, springback, residual stress, etc.
- **Contact analysis**: Marc Mentat has a superior and intuitive contact modeling capability that can handle interaction between multiple components in 1-D, 2-D or 3-D. It can also model self-contact without additional effort. It can analyze the effects of friction and related material changes with ease.
- **Nonlinear materials**: Marc Mentat has an extensive library of metallic and non-metallic material models that can accurately capture the behavior of various materials used in engineering designs. It can also model isotropic, orthotropic and anisotropic elasticity; isotropic and anisotropic plasticity; hyperelasticity (elastomeric materials); time-dependent and time-independent behavior; powder metals; soils; concrete; shape memory alloys; solder; composites; piezoelectricity; etc.
- **User-friendly interface**: Mentat is a graphical user interface that allows users to easily create and modify models, define loads and boundary conditions, assign material properties and element types, run analyses, visualize results, and generate reports. It also has a built-in scripting language that enables users to automate tasks and customize functions.
